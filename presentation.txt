# Owner Financing: Unlocking Value in Vacant Land Sales

## Slide 1: What is Owner Financing?
- **Definition**
  - Seller acts as the lender, allowing buyers to pay for land through a down payment and monthly installments.
  - No traditional bank loan required, making it ideal for vacant land buyers.
- **Why It Matters**
  - Expands buyer pool, especially for those who can’t secure bank financing.
  - Offers sellers higher sale prices and consistent cash flow.
- **Presentation Goals**
  - Showcase real-world examples of owner-financed land deals.
  - Demonstrate strategies, benefits, and risk management.
  - Inspire action to leverage owner financing for your land.

## Slide 2: Advantages for Land Sellers
- **Increased Sale Price**
  - Buyers pay a premium for flexible terms.
  - Example: Florida 44 acres bought for $150,000, sold for $249,000 with $75,000 down and $2,500/month for 99 months.
- **Reliable Income Stream**
  - Monthly payments create predictable cash flow.
  - Example: Georgia 100 acres split into 10 parcels, generating ~$5,600/month from 8 parcels at $700/month each.
- **Broader Market Appeal**
  - Attracts buyers with limited financing options.
  - Example: Louisiana 11 acres sold for $5,000 down and $750/month for 10 years.
- **Customizable Terms**
  - Sellers control down payment, interest rate, and loan duration.
  - Example: Florida 40 acres with $100,000 total down ($60,000 + $40,000 later) and $2,600/month for 144 months.

## Slide 3: Crafting an Owner-Financed Deal
- **Essential Elements**
  - **Down Payment**: Immediate capital and risk reduction.
    - Example: Louisiana 18 acres with $10,000 down and $1,000/month for 10 years.
  - **Monthly Payments**: Based on loan balance, interest rate, and term.
    - Example: Florida 13 acres with $20,000 down and $1,600/month for 60 months.
  - **Loan Term**: Short-term (5–10 years) or long-term with balloons.
    - Example: Louisiana 80 acres with a 30-year note, 15-year balloon of $210,000.
- **Interest Rates**
  - Often 6–10% to reflect risk and market conditions.
- **Balloon Payments**
  - Final lump sum to clear the note.
  - Example: Louisiana 80 acres note valued at $250,000, balloon payment of $210,000 after 15 years.

- **Financial Outcome**
  - Total payments: $100,000 (down) + $374,400 (144 × $2,600) = $474,400.
  - Profit: $474,400 - $210,000 = $264,400.

## Slide 6: Case Study 3 – Georgia 100 Acres
- **Purchase and Preparation**
  - Purchased for $235,000.
  - Invested ~$12,500 in surveying/mulching to create 10 parcels of 10 acres.
- **Sale Strategy**
  - 8 parcels sold with $9,000 down and $700/month for 10 years.

- **Financial Outcome**
  - Cash received: $100,000 (cash sales) + $72,000 (8 × $9,000).
  - Monthly income: ~$5,600 (8 × $700).
  - Total over 10 years: $672,000 (8 × $700 × 120) + $100,000 = $772,000.
  - Profit: $772,000 - $247,500 (purchase + prep) ≈ $524,500.
- **Key Takeaway**
  - Subdividing land maximizes revenue and accelerates sales.

## Slide 7: Managing Risks in Owner Financing
- **Potential Risks**
  - **Buyer Default**: Non-payment leads to repossession.
    - Mitigation: Require meaningful down payments (e.g., $75,000 for Florida 44 acres).
    - Retain title until note is paid.
  - **Market Risks**: Declining land values impact repossessed property.
    - Mitigation: Diversify across multiple deals (e.g., Georgia’s 10 parcels).
  - **Carrying Costs**: Taxes, maintenance, or underlying loans.
    - Mitigation: Ensure payments cover costs (e.g., Louisiana 80 acres nets $800/month after loan).
- **Best Practices**
  - Screen buyers for financial stability.
  - Use airtight legal contracts drafted by professionals.
  - Consider shorter terms or balloons for high-risk buyers.
